# Required environment variables
export WEBHOOK_ID_MULA="your_mula_webhook_id"
export WEBHOOK_TOKEN_MULA="your_mula_webhook_token"
export WEBHOOK_ID_OAK="your_oak_webhook_id"
export WEBHOOK_TOKEN_OAK="your_oak_webhook_token"
export WEBHOOK_ID_ERROR="your_error_webhook_id"
export WEBHOOK_TOKEN_ERROR="your_error_webhook_token"

# Optional environment variables
export MODE="DEVELOPMENT"  # Set to "DEVELOPMENT" to send all notifications to error webhook
```

3. Build and run:
```bash
go build
./deshimula-notifier-unofficial
```

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with the following components:

### Base Package
- Provides common functionality for story services
- Handles Discord notifications
- Manages story storage
- Implements first-run handling
- Provides HTTP client configuration

### Service Implementations
- `Mula`: Implements Deshimula story parsing
- `Oak`: Implements Oak story parsing
- Both services inherit common functionality from the base package

### Error Handling
- Implements retry mechanism for failed operations
- Configurable retry attempts and delays
- Comprehensive error types and messages

### Storage
- Efficient storage of processed stories
- Prevents duplicate notifications
- Persists across service restarts

## First Run Behavior

On the first run, the service:
1. Processes only the most recent story (to show it in Discord)
2. Marks all other stories as seen (to prevent them from being processed in future runs)
3. Subsequent runs process only new stories
